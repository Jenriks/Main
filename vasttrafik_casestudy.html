        <h1>Project summary</h1>
        <p>
        Västtrafik is responsible for the public transportations in western Sweden. They have over 400,000 customers in all ages travel with their buses, trains, trams and boats every day.
        With this in mind their travel planner (both for the ToGo app and desktop version) must both be very user friendly and contain a lot of complex information at the same time.
        To get both quantitative and qualitative data to analyze we did both surveys and with semi-structured interviews.
        Our next step was to conduct usability tests based on 8 scenarios, created after our persona's needs, goals and pain points.
        </p>
        <p>
        We tested the usability the ToGo app and the desktop version "Reseplaneraren" (the travel planner).
        The goal of the study was to find out how effective both platforms were, how easily users could interact with them, did they meet requirements and expectations of the users, to find usability problems and identify areas for improvement.

            <h2>Defining and understanding the user</h2>
            <p>Our first step was to figure out who the primary user is -who most frequently uses Västtrafik and it's travel planner when using public transportations.
              I put together a survey with 20 questions and to get more qualitative data as a complement to the survey all of the team members conducted semi-structured interviews.
              </p><br>
              <p>We did the research method semi-structured because it allows the interviewer to follow up questions and exploration of new topics that arise during the interview alongside with the structured part, which is pre-determined questions. With this method we got a deeper understanding of the user with more qualitative data such as needs, opinions, pain points and goals.

          </div>
        <h2>Persona</h2>
        <p>After we analyzed all data we came up with a persona, which we call Malin and she's a student. Malin made it easier for us to understand the target user and stay focused on her needs and goals while using Västtrafiks travel planner, both in ToGo-appen and the desktop version.</p>

          <div class="text">
          <h2>Before testing</h2>
          <p>We created eight different scenarios based on our personas four primary needs:</p>
          <br>
          <i><p>Economical</p>
          <p>Loves to exercise</p>
          <p>Easily frustrated when she can't navigate around new places</p>

        </div>

        <h2>Usability tests</h2>
        <p>Each one of us in the team was responsible for two test sessions: One remote and one in-person. Before the tests we created a checklist that everyone used when being a facilitator. This is important because we want the every test to have as similar conditions as possible and not have different results because of everyone's different facilitating approach.
        </p>
        <p>We had eight participants test eight scenarios in total and each participant tested four scenarios from the ToGo app or four scenarios from the desktop version Reseplaneraren.
        </p>

          </div>
        <p>We used the method of Think out loud and it means that the participant talks out loud the entire time and explains what they are doing, what they expect to happen and anything that comes to mind.</p>
        <p>This is a good way to collect qualitative data and let us get a deep understanding of how the user think and what their expectations are during the process of using the product.</p>
        
        <p>Some of the tests had a additional questions to them in form of a SEQ -Single Ease Question- which is a 7-point rating scale to assess how difficult users find a task.The SEQ measures the users' perception of usability based on the last attempted scenario.</p>
        <p>Our next step was to transcribe all interviews and color code it to easier see patterns and to be sure not to miss any important data.</p>

        <h1>Result and insights</h1>
        <p>After analyzing the data the final result showed us that the testers were positive about the basic functions that both platforms could offer, such as planning trips and providing various tickets.</p>       
        <p>But what contributed to a negative experience for the users was that it was very difficult to navigate when you wanted specific information about something or wanted to do a task that was not in the day-to-day use of the travel planners.</p>     
        <p>Another observation that was often made was that there is a large discrepancy between the offerings/design on the two different platforms, which contributed to some frustration.</p>

        <section class="container4">
          <h2>Top 3 positive finds:</h2>
          <p>1. In the ToGo app, the user intuitively understands how to plan a trip. It's easy to search, plan and see the trip - you don't have to be familiar with how it works to understand and use it successfully.</p>
          <p>2. It's convenient and easy that you can enter an address instead of a specific bus/tram stop</p>
          <p>3. The map function is a very good feature that is easy to use regardless of whether you are taking public transport, walking, or cycling. It's especially useful that it can be opened directly in the map function on your smartphone if you use it through the ToGo app.</p>

        <section class="container4">
          <h2>Top 3 negative finds:</h2>
          <p>1. Västtrafik is focused on promoting sustainable travel (including public transport, cycling, and walking), but it's too difficult to access this information from a navigation standpoint. Since it's highlighted as important to them and is something they are actively working on, these points and projects should be more easily accessible to users so they can choose the most environmentally friendly way to travel.
          <p>2. No specific option for a student ticket. To find out the cost of a student ticket, you need to click on "Youth" and read more information, which was not entirely clear to most test subjects.</p>
          <p>3. Even when you know exactly what you're looking for, it can be difficult to find the right answer. This is because there is a large amount of text and information on Västtrafik's website, making it difficult to navigate.</p>

      <h2>Presenting results to client</h2>
      <p>Me and my team had the pleasure of being chosen to <b>present our study to Västtrafik</b> and their UX/UI-team, product owners and developers.</p>
      <p>When presenting the results of our project we highlighted the <b>key findings and insights</b> gathered from user testing, such as common pain points, areas where users struggled to complete tasks and results that surprised us.</p>
      <p>To help the client better understand the results we talked them through all of the scenarios and the results of each one.</p>

      <h1>Lessons learned</h1>
      <p><b>User testing is crucial!</b> It's important to test all digital tools with actual users, and with more than one (I guess it should be the famous five testers). When observing their behavior, taking part of what they think and collecting feedback, you really gain valuable insights that can be used to improve the user experience</p>
      <p><b>The importance of being prepared</b>, regardless if it's for a survey, an hour-long interview, or a daily Teams meeting - especially if you're new at it.</p>
      <p><b>Collaboration is key!</b> Working together, with the combination of daily meetings and working on your own, makes the daily work very effective.</p>
      <p><b>Testing the test!</b> An easy way to find errors in your test that need to be corrected, modify questions to get more useful data, and get more practice as a facilitator and get comfortable in that position.</p>
